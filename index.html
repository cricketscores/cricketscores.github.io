First mentioned as the “Citadel of București” in 1459, it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler. Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest: The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators (Phanariotes) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest. [19] The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire. Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu). Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by Caragea’s plague in 1813–14, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and Imperial Russia (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later, an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city. "

GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free-custom domain name and all. What is Jekyll?: Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. You create your content as text files (Markdown), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using Liquid-enhanced HTML templates. Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server. Jekyll happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your project’s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHub’s servers for free. "

    "body": "Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.  Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it.  Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.

Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.

    "body": "The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.

If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits!

    "title": "A Fast String Clustering Algorithm Using Networks",
    "body": "2023/03/30 - The algorithm I want to outline in this post was developed for string clustering although it can be used for a wide range of analogous problems as well. The algorithm has several distinctive features: it does not need us to specify the number of clusters present in the dataset upfront; it does not require samples to have vector representations as long as we have some way to compute “connectedness” or distance between them; and does not make any assumptions about clusters being convex or having isotropic distributions and can detect clusters of complex shapes.  Let’s take the above characteristics one at a time. Many common clustering algorithms such as K-means require us to specify the number of clusters we want to divide the data into ahead of time. This can indeed be useful, especially when dealing with noisy data without clear boundaries where we know there are a definite number of categories present in the data. However, there are many instances where we don’t know ahead of time how many groups there are in the data. For example, if we had a bag of M&amp;Ms and knew ahead of time it only consisted of red, green, and blue, we could say K = 3 and cluster them. But imagine we have a bag of various colors we want to separate but we don’t know how many colors there are. In this case, we would want to use an algorithm that doesn’t need K to be stated up-front as a parameter. Next, while most machine learning algorithms will deal with samples that are represented as vectors – i. e. if we have m samples where each is distributed over n features, we would start with an m x n matrix. Distances between various samples can be computed with an assortment of distance metrics, for example the commonly used Euclidean distance. However, on occasion, we might have samples where we are able to compute similarity or distance between them as a quantitative or categorical score (for example, connected/not connected), but where representing the samples in a vector form that can be ingested by most algorithms is either impossible or cumbersome. For example, in the case of strings containing related words or variant spellings, we might compute similarity using some metric like the Levenshtein string similarity algorithm. So, for example we might say the words “round” and “mound” have a distance or cost of 1 because we only need to switch out one letter to get from one to the other. Similarly, “book” and “back” have a distance of 2 etc – the scores being based on the number of substitutions, insertions, and deletions required. Such scores are a standard part of many Natural Language Processing tasks and offer a great deal of customizability based on problem domains. For example, if we were creating a screen typing autocorrect algorithm, we might want to treat “round” and “found” as more similar than “round” and “mound” because, even though both require The switch of a single letter, “r” and “f” are next to each other on the keyboard while “r” and “m” are far apart. Such algorithms might be really powerful and customizable ways of quantifying distances between samples, but they have no obvious vector representation that can be plugged into the usual expected matrix format. To accommodate for this, many clustering algorithms will accept square matrices (or their sparse representations) or precomputed pairwise distances. Finally, many algorithms have expectations about the ways in which samples are distributed – for example, that they follow gaussian distributions, or are equally or symmetrically distributed along various axes. Others, mainly density based or hierarchical clustering algorithms, avoid such assumptions and can learn complex distribution shapes. The Algorithm: The basic algorithm is quite simple. For any pair of points (p, q) we call an edge generation function e(). This function will usually be a distance function but can use any domain specific criteria to decide whether the pair of points (p, q) meet the threshold for being in the same cluster. If the criteria is met, we record an edge between the points in a network. Once all points in the sample set have been compared pairwise, we partition the resulting final network into disjointed set. Each set is a cluster of similar points. The number of sets produced is K, our number of clusters. Note that, as long as the edge function e(p, p) returns true, a node is at least connected with itself and thus we allow single item nodes. Initialize graph g;For a pairs (p,q) in samples set S:e(p,q) == True:	Add nodes p and q to g;	Add edge p&lt;--&gt;q;Partition network g into disjointed subnetworks;This might seem trivially simple, but it offers great versatility in many use cases. Let’s try it first with a very small subset of 10 strings selected from a 90,000 sample dataset I was working on. These are name variants of printers and publishers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They come from an immensely complex and interesting corpus of historical publishing data. Domain expertise really comes handy when devising the edge function for such a dataset. But for now let’s leave that aside and see if our algorithm can solve the clustering problem and discover that these 10 strings can be grouped into 3 clusters: 'William Caxton', 'Wyllyam Caxton', 'Wylliam Caxston', 'William Caxton', 'Wynken de Worde', 'Winkyn de Word', 'Wynkin de Word', 'Richard Pynson', 'Richard Pinson', 'Rickard Pinson' Here’s the python code, using the networkx library. import networkx as nxgraph = nx. Graph()for i1,s1 in enumerate(samples):   for i2,s2 in enumerate(samples[:i1]):	if weighted_levenshtein(s1, s2):	  graph. add_edge(i1, i2) sub_g = nx. connected_components(graph)# Let’s print out the resultsfor i, cluster in enumerate(sub_g):  print(f'Cluster: {i}')  for item_index in cluster:	print(f'\t{samples[item_index]}')This produces the following output:   Cluster: 0	Wyllyam Caxton	Wylliam Caxston	William Caxton	William Caxton  Cluster: 1	Winkyn de Word	Wynkin de Word	Wynken de Worde  Cluster: 2	Richard Pinson	Richard Pynson	Rickard PinsonThe network of 10 nodes that is generated has the following structure: Note that even though we are calling the edge/distance function N^2/2 times within the loop, this can also be a pre-computed matrix. However, the vast majority of these calls will be able to return 0/False results really fast and only a relatively small number of calls will actually have to go through the time-consuming Levenshtein calculation (see below). If you have experience with clustering algorithms, the above characteristics will tell you that they are shared by density based clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN and indeed the approach I am describing here has very strong similarities to density based clustering. There are a few key conceptual and implementation differences though that made this a better and faster choice for my implementation. To understand why, let’s look a little more closely at the problem. The Problem: Here, in brief, is the problem I set out to solve. I started with a spreadsheet containing roughly 90,000 names extracted using regular expressions from a large corpus of books printed in England between 1473 and 1700.  Our task is to identify unique names in this list. What looks like a trivially simple problem actually proves to be extremely complicated because spelling conventions in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were utterly chaotic (a fun example: Shakespeare’s name can be found with more than 80 spelling variants). Moreover, beside the usual wild spelling variations, sometimes initials are used, and sometimes Latin names – so John can show up as Iohannis. To make things even more interesting, sometimes names were shared by fathers and sons and the only way to tell them apart is from other clues such as dates when they published books and, of course, highly specialized scholarly domain knowledge. Note, finally, that we also don’t know how many total names there are – so K is unknown – and there are many names that occur only once, i. e. clusters can range in size from many hundreds in case of a prolific printer who printed many books to single-sample clusters. This is where data preprocessing and domain knowledge becomes very important. Using some techniques I will leave for a later post, I manage to standardize the names as much as possible. Name abbreviations, variants, and initials were considered, Latin names were turned into English, common typographic practices such as using “vv” for “w” were corrected for etc. But we are still left with 90,000 widely variant names. And even though these names don’t have easy vector representations, we could certainly use Levenshtein distances as a similarity metric and generate a pairwise distance matrix. This could, theoretically, be plugged into an algorithm like scikit-learn’s implementation of DBSCAN that in the latest version now accepts a “precomputed” parameter and a pairwise distance grid in lieu of vectors. But this would result in a grid with well over 8 billion cells and 4 billion calls to the Levenshtein distance routine (each call is quite complex and time-consuming). So again, I turned to a bit of domain knowledge to massively optimize this dataset. I used a fast prescreener to throw out name-pairs that weren’t viable reducing the set to a few hundred thousand and then used highly adjustable weights in the Levenshtein algorithm learned from my prior study of spelling variation in the period and the fact that some letters are often substituted by others (e. g. “u”/“v”, “i”/“j” etc). 1 Thus, potentially N^2 distance calculations are heavily reduced by culling using computationally cheap metrics. Now, you might notice that a network is essentially a representation of a sparse matrix where non-zero cells represent edges between nodes. Thus, the similarities between this very simple approach and density based approaches becomes clear. Originally, many of these algorithms either insisted on vector representations or complete pairwise distance grids. But current optimized implementations in the latest version of scikit-learn for example, allow for pre-computed sparse matrices that when combined with viable epsilon thresholds and a min_sample of 1, produce comparable results. But this implementation retains a significant speed advantage because the network structure only requires writing to a dictionary instead of the comparatively more complex scipy. sparse matrix implementations. Apart from the elegance and simplicity, this implementation can be easily adapted to other uses. For example edge weights or node properties can be created while building the network, allowing further manipulation of sub-groups once clustering is completed. Thresholds can also be modified to eliminate smaller clusters as noise or to facilitate other network based machine learning algorithms. But more on such possibilities later. The current implementation – which is so trivially simple that it could be rewritten without the networkx library using pure python dictionaries in a few lines of code – is a great opportunity to explore ways of learning highly complex patterns and thinking about what a little bit of domain knowledge can do to optimize machine learning tasks.

    "title": "Visualizing the History of Test Cricket",
    "body": "2023/03/22 - This post grew out of some interesting discussions on data-visualization in a class I taught. I will use data on test cricket matches played by all the major cricketing nations gathered from Cricinfo’s Statsguru database to hastily sketch a couple of points, but my focus here is data-visualization, not the culture and history of cricket.  I will not deny that this post runs considerable risk of getting distracted into encomia about the wonder and enigma that is test cricket. But I will do my best to avoid it. If you are unfamiliar with test cricket, I will refrain from telling you why what looks like five days of men standing around watching grass grow is really an extended metaphor for all that is pure in human nature; that what, to untrained eyes, might look like a dreary spectacle is actually the fiery drama of grit and perseverance, of elegance and valor, sin and redemption. Instead I’ll ask a more prosaic question: how much does one need to know about test cricket to read this visualization, and indeed to create it? Is a visualization a self-contained representation of facts, or is it embedded in a cultural perspective? Obviously, it is both. But what are good visualization practices that might help us balance the two without overwhelming either? How do we fit as much objective information as possible into a visualization without sacrificing a clear, easily recognizable narrative? First, here is the objective description of the data. Each visualization maps every home or away test match played by a nation in their entire history. Each bar represents all the tests played in a series (the year is at the bottom, the opposing or “touring” team at the top). Wins are blue, losses are red and drawn matches are gray. So far, so simple. The wavy blue line is a running average indicative of “form” that scores a home win as 3 points, a home loss as minus 5 points and a home draw as 1 point. Away, the scores change slightly: an away win is 5 points, and a loss away from home is only minus 3, while draws remain unchanged. These are the facts of how to read the graph. Are they sufficient? Quite apparently not. Fans of other sports would certainly be familiar with home-field advantage, but might wonder if it’s enough of a factor to merit a whole separate graph. Those with “domain knowledge” about test cricket might explain that several factors contribute to home advantage in test cricket including the weather and the pitch. The ball swings and seams (moves in the air and off the pitch) more in England, spins more off the dry pitches of the Indian subcontinent and bounces more on the fast wickets of Australia. Home teams know their conditions better and can custom make pitches to suit their strengths. So much so that often a team’s home and away performances will differ widely. An all conquering team at home – like India in the 1990s – couldn’t be called a truly great side until it dominated abroad as well. Hence, two graphs. But notice, the moment we stepped into the comforting assurance of domain knowledge we entered a realm of subjectivity and interpretation – things on which reasonably informed people might disagree.  Now that the utter dispassionate objectivity of our data (“here are the results of every test match played by Australia”) looks slightly shaken, let us stir it further. Which parts of the graphs are objective facts and which more interpretive? Surely, the results of the test matches are objective. Well what if the “objective” facets of the data flattens nuance one might care about? A cowardly draw settled for because a team refused to chase an enticing final innings target is not the same as a valiantly achieved tie off the last ball. Well, the data-scientist reminds us, we are dealing with results, not some abstraction such as glory. To say that in the 1960 tour of Australia, the West Indies team lost two matches, drew two, and won one is a clear statement of what happened. Yes, of course. But one might care for more dimensions than are captured in the bare surface of the data. One of those drawn matched was the first tied test, and the closely contested matches in this famed “Calypso series” would signal the first phase of West Indian ascendency. This is not to say that at least some aspect of the frustratingly qualitative and subjective category – “glory” let’s call it – involved in so many not-quite-victorious sporting causes could not be captured in a visualization. We might shade matches by margin of win for example. Or take the opposition ranking and form into account. This is what something like a Elo ranking system (most widely known in FIDE chess rankings but used elsewhere including in cricket rankings) does. But notice that adding rhetorical nuance in one aspect would probably come at the cost of clarity in another. The graph already shows a massive number of data points – every match ever played by a team. Adding shades (or perhaps weighted widths or heights) would likely make it extremely cluttered and hard to read, like overwhelming a gripping narrative with rambly footnotes. So I chose a slightly different compromise. Separate out the objective part of the data from the more interpretive narrative I want to weave. The results of the matches remain untouched, but are overlaid by a form curve that tries to capture the ebb and flow of the fortunes of national teams, their flights of glory or depths of disappointment. This overlay is computed using the scoring system noted above – it isn’t some magical subjective quality, it comes “from the data. ” But one couldn’t argue that it is objective in the same way as the rest of the plot. Any serious cricket fan is likely to have differences with my scoring scheme. Away draws should carry more weight than home draws. The quality of the opposition should be taken into account. When a team wins in conditions most different from their own, that should be noted. First away victories are more monumental occasions. The nuances might be endless, and we might quibble on them. But the point is that these are nuances, subject to interpretation, rooted in, but a projection from the facts. So, enjoy my attempts at depicting a massive quantity of information in a way that is tractable and yet to try and tell a story with it that helps the viewer see the quick contours of the vast over a century old landscape of this wonderful sport. Look at the Statsguru result table for the West Indies to get a sense of how difficult it is to grasp a team’s fortunes from the raw data, and compare it to story of rising swagger in the mid sixties followed by almost two decades of supreme dominance home and away playing cricket of sublime beauty and lethal precision. There are many more narratives in the graphs for the other teams below – plots and subplots, struggles and redemptive moments – in here. I will leave you to find them as you enjoy the plots and perhaps complain about how it limits or hides important aspects of the data. But when you do complain, notice how what you are complaining about is enmeshed in the rhetorical capacities of data and its visualization.   "

    "title": "The Shapes of Stories, Part 1: Exploring Plot Structure with Networks",
    "body": "2023/01/01 - Stories impose shapes on the world. Narrative emerges out of a process of selective attention – of extracting a salient structure of events out of chaotic complexity, of choosing one path out of innumerable possible ones through the forest. From Aristotle to contemporary philosophers, literary critics and anthropologists, the identification and grouping of narrative shapes has been a problem that has continued to fascinate. Data scientists are only the latest addition to the long tradition of intellectuals intrigued by the shapes of stories. This is the first part of what I hope will turn into a series of quantitative and computational explorations of plot. In this introduction, we will begin by exploring how qualitative ways of thinking about plot might help our approach. For the technical details of building the graphs, see part 2. 	Play : 		 		Color by : 							Status			Gender				Use the slider to adjust links: This visualization should work on most current standards compliant browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Safari. If you can't see the networks, please try again with a standards compliant browser (and drop me a note). The plots are extracted from a corpus of Shakespeare’s plays. Each node represents a character; a connection indicates interaction between them. Where data was available, nodes are either colored by gender, or status (shades from purple: royal, to green:poor commoner). You can use the slider to progressively cut weaker links between nodes to reveal significant character clusters and plot structures. Use the dropdown menu to explore different plays. Aristotle’s declaration in his Poetics, that a plot should have a beginning, a middle, and an end might seem childishly obvious, but highlights a crucial point – that we tend to think of narrative as events unfolding in time. Of course, the kind of events that unfold in time matter hugely in creating the proper effect of the narrative. In fact, Poetics is a detailed elaboration of this for one particular kind of plot – tragedy. But nevertheless the chronological order of the unfolding of events is a key element of our understanding of plot. My favorite Shakespearean example of this is to compare Othello to a conventional comedy like As You Like It. Othello begins with a marriage, ends with several deaths and the utter collapse of the protagonist’s world. As You Like It, on the other hand, begins in crisis following a death but eventually finds its way to harmonious resolution and ends with a bunch of marriages. Both plays deal with roughly analogous themes – love, loyalty, friendship, trust – the little individual things that add up to the foundation of social order. But how these elements are arranged in time makes one a tragedy and the other a comedy. To ignore the order of arrangement of these events – as one might, for example in a text-analysis approach that turns an entire play into a bag-of-words – might reveal that they share many linguistic and thematic similarities, as has been demonstrated in a fascinating study by Jonathan Hope and Michael Witmore,1 but make us miss the crucial fact that the arrangement of these events makes them very different kinds of narrative. Over the last century or so, the question of plot shape has continued to draw attention. In the early twentieth century, the school of critics known as the Russian Formalists spent considerable time discussing plot, the exemplary work here being Vladimir Propp’s wonderful book The Morphology of the Folk Tale. Anthropologists from Levi Strauss to Pierre Bourdieu, and literary theorists from Roland Barthes to Gérard Gennette have written about narrative in terms of what they call “structure. ” The most familiar among such discussions of plot might be Kurt Vonnegut’s entertaining lecture on the topic where he visualizes the shapes of stories as a kind of sentiment graph where time is plotted on the X axis and the Y axis represents positive or negative sentiment score. Not only is Vonnegut’s exploration rather amusing and engaging, it might especially appeal to data-scientists. In fact, Matthew Jockers has used sentiment analysis to realize Vonnegut’s insight and extended it in fascinating ways. Such a model of plot as essentially a time series of sentiment scores has the great virtue of retaining the Aritotelian dictum of development through time and an understanding of plot as a function of emotion – which, after all, is the most immediate way we engage with narrative. We dread bad outcomes, and anticipate good ones. We cheer for heroic characters and root against the bad guys. We shudder at crisis and revel in their resolution. But there is perhaps another element to plot that eludes this purely chronological unfolding of sentiment and might supplement our understanding of it. And most contemporary thinkers about narrative – including the “structuralists” mentioned above – have tried to approach what we might think of as this non-linear quality of plot. Think about it: if you hear the title The Tragedy of Macbeth, you immediately know the rough chronological shape of the story: things are going to start out relatively okay, there’s going to be some kind of massive crisis and downfall, and a bunch of people are going to end up dead. It’s all going to be very sad. But there is obviously more to Macbeth than the raw outline of the plot (which Shakespeare borrowed from elsewhere anyway). It is the interplay of character and language and motif and imagery – in other words the countless little building blocks at the disposal of the author – that are combined in particular ways to give plot its proper affect. The Art of Storytelling: From Chronology to Symbolic SpaceThe concept of structure pays attention to dimensions of plot other than its purely chronological shape and tries to incorporate thematic elements that organize and shape the reception of the sequence of events. In other words, it tries to capture dimensions of narrative that don’t work chronologically but rather takes the form of accumulative world building. Obviously when we read or watch stories unfold – in books, or theater, or film – we consume the text in a linear manner. But narrative can resist this simple linearity in multiple ways. Flashbacks, and non-linear representations of time are one set of obvious ways to do it. But I would argue that even when a story is being told perfectly chronologically, the text invites us to organize its narrative in a kind of symbolic space. We notice character associations, thematic elements, ethical perspectives etc. To return to the example of Macbeth, we would miss crucial elements of the narrative if we reduced it to a mere chronological ebb and flow of sentiment. It would be like having a really bad storyteller narrate the plot of the play as a series of events – Macbeth meets the witches, then Duncan, then his wife etc – without inviting us to actively participate and build a set of mental connections. And Shakespeare is far from a bad storyteller. Generations of critics have discussed how the plot of a play like Macbeth “works” – how it produces certain affects, how it invites us to pay attention to certain things. We read the play – one might even say that the play compels us to read it – by supplementing the chronological unfolding of narrative with other elements. We draw associations. We make connections and comparisons. When Macbeth is named Thane of Cawdor by Duncan’s messengers this is not an isolated event. In fact, it only takes on its significance in the narrative because it refers back to the witches’ prophecy, and Banquo’s very different reaction; it also reveals and anticipates Macbeth’s ambition and conflict. When Lady Macbeth admonishes her husband for his infirmity of purpose, it is not sufficient to note the fact that she is overly ambitious and somewhat domineering. Shakespeare’s language leaves clues for us. She might or might not jump out as the “fourth witch” for every reader, but the fact that she is a catalyst spurring on the struggle between allegiance and ambition unfolding in Macbeth is undeniable. In other words, at every moment the narrative is self reflexive, it doesn’t merely proceed through time, it folds back on itself, it looks forward. It sets up effects for us to notice, tensions to resolve later. In short, it invites us to participate in building the world of the play. Plot, therefore, is as much a contour in symbolic space as it is a time series. Aristotle observed that while plot dictates character, in great drama it emanates out of character. If an author is in perfect control of characters, their natural interactions will give rise to the machinations of plot.  A network perspective invites us to think of narrative within such symbolic space, beyond the strict tyranny of chronological unfolding. It is as if Shakespeare puts these characters one by one in front of us, and invites us to build the network of their interactions to truly appreciate the structure of the play. In the second part of this series, I will describe the technical details of how these networks were built and turn my attention to some really interesting recent work on networks as a mode of thinking about plot. But if you play around with the network above, notice how the entirety of a play starts out as a jumble of interactions. Color by gender and notice that apart from the innocent Lady Macduff, how Macbeth is surrounded by female figures who draw him into what he calls “the river of blood. ” Then, as you start to strip away the less important connections (use the slider) Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are left all alone by themselves – lady Macbeth intensely lonely and isolated, cut off from everyone else and driven to insanity; and Macbeth surrounded with enemies closing in and the ghosts of those he has killed.

    "body": "2022/06/25 -  I built this graph a while ago partly because I came across the data one afternoon when I was bored, but partly because I was prepping to teach dataviz. I wanted an exercise for students where they could start out with a large amount of data on a single graph and then have a conversation about what salient points they would pick out to outline the long arc of history that the data covers. I scaled up all games to the modern 3 points for a win and 1 for a draw scoring system to make comparison across eras easier. The band in the middle maps the standard deviation of the distribution of points and tells its own story. We see the consolidation of English soccer in the early days where the wide deviation could be explained by the presence of weaker amateur teams in the league who were then gradually eliminated. In more recent decades we see the influx of TV rights and more and more money culminating in the Premier League era resulting in wider margins yet again. Some of the things we discussed about the visualization in class: Does the anecdotal and arbitrary selection of points enrich our sense of the data? Does it impose a modern bias on the data that is distortive? Would this work better as an interactive visualization – what interactive features would you add? We also practiced our data cleaning and formatting skills in class by using the same dataset to create the following animated visualization using an online visualization portal. It shows the cumulative number of points earned by clubs over time under a uniform 3 for win, 1 for draw system. I was surprised to see that Sunderland, Villa, and Everton were the most successful English clubs until the 1970s, and Everton wasn’t toppled from it’s most cumulative points position until 2005!   "

    "body": "2022/01/12 - I created these Python notes to get students started on the absolute basics of Python within a 4 week time period. One of the great joys of teaching NLP/text-analysis/corpus-linguistics in a humanities setting is the wide range of students you tend to recruit – from CS majors who come into the class with fairly advanced coding chops, to people who have deep critical reading skills and domain knowledge but almost no technical expertise. This makes for great cross-disciplinary conversations. I absolutely love to observe the dynamic that forms over the semester – maybe a humanities grad student learning coding skills from a computer-science sophomore and, in turn, helping the undergrads formulate sophisticated, interesting problems and projects to leverage their budding data-skills. But managing and catering to this astonishing range of skills presents challenges. One gets to spend very little time on the nuts and bolts fundamentals before being thrown into the deep end, as it were, of language processing, statistical analysis, even tidbits of machine learning. Partly, this is a handicap to overcome and perhaps not the “right way” to teach programming - students often end up doing comparatively advanced stuff while their fundamentals are still quite shaky. But on the other hand, I believe it is the most practical way to engage humanities students many of whom take these classes to figure out whether 1) they have an aptitude for programming, and 2) whether computational methods might be relevant to their research concerns. They can’t afford to spend multiple semesters learning programming the right way before they get to advanced string processing and text-analysis and then to finally figure out whether they can use it in their work. They need to get to the interesting stuff and, if its relevant, they’ll stick around and hone up their fundamentals. Many have gone on to engage with computing deeply in their research resulting in papers, dissertation chapters etc that marry quantitative perspectives and tools with qualitative questions. So, these notes below are my take on the bare minimum amount of Python students need to catch up on before we can start taking on somewhat conceptual problems. You can find a git repo here with some additional class exercises, problems to solve etc to go with these notes.  Install Python: We will use Python 3. x for this course. Download and install Python using the Anaconda distribution A Few Python Resources:: Websites::  The official Python documentation: The ultimate authority on all things Python. Has a tutorial, and some nice beginner’s guides. Can be terse and cryptic and times, but is always thorough and exhaustive. Bookmark-worthy! Dive into Python is an excellent online book on Python.  Learn Python the Hard Way is another good online book. Books:: If you’d like to buy a paper book consider the following (in addition to print editions of the above ones):  Think Python: Nicely organized introduction, also available as PDF Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science: Covers a lot of ground, but a good first book as well. Not introductory tutorials, but here are two great reference books on Python to have around:  Python Essential Reference: I prefer this one.  Python in a NutshellNavigating the terminal - files and folders: I’ll expect you to familiarize yourself with basic navigation using the command line. Commands you should have a familiarity with include pwd, cd, ls, and chmod. Under Windows, Anaconda should start a Unix like shell. Running Python: We will use three major ways (with some variation) to run Python.  In the terminal, type python to start an interactive Python interpreter. You can type in python commands and hit enter to execute. Type exit() to get back to the shell.  Write a Python program using any plaintext editor (or IDE, like Spyder) and save it with a . py extension – say test. py. Now from the commandline, run the program by typing python test. py. This will run the text file through the python interpreter. In Unix environments, you can do the following to mark the program as an executable and to have it automatically run through Python: Put the following on the first line of your program. #!/usr/bin/env python3 and then after saving the program change its permissions to executable by typing chmod 755 test. py. Now just typing . /test. py should run the program.  Start an interactive Python notebook by typing jupyter notebook. Type in python commands in the text box and hit shift-enter to execute. Why Python?: Now that we have IPython running, let’s review of some basic concepts about the structure of Python and how it compares to other languages: Python is an interpreted language (often called “scripting” language) (like Ruby, PHP etc. ) as opposed to compiled languages (C, C++, Javaetc).  In other words, Python code is not translated into machine level instructions beforehand - it’s interpreted on-the-fly while executing.  This often results in easier-to-write code but slower execution times.  But a lot of libraries that we use from within Python are written in highly optimized C as is Python itself. So, well-designed code that takes advantage of fast libraries can often run much faster than pure Python implementations. Python is a dynamically typed language as opposed to statically typed languages like C, C++, Java etc.  We don’t have to declare variable types explicitly or reserve memory for all variables in advance.  Python can infer the type of a variable and change it as necessary depending on the value we assign - we don’t have to explicitly declare a variable as int, float etc. i. e. Python is implicitly typed. For example, in the C language, if you wanted to store an integer in a variable, you’d have to declare the variable and its type explicitly. In the code snippet below, a is declared as an integer before it is used and cannot store any other data type: int a;a = 42;In Python, we not have to declare the variable type ahead of using it. The interpreter will deduce the data type from the variable. In fact, we can assign another type of data to the same variable later and Python will change the data-type internally. Note also the use of the type() function to return the current data type and the print() function to print to the terminal. a = 42print(type(a))a = 4. 0print(type(a))a =  Hello, World print(type(a))&lt;class 'int'&gt;&lt;class 'float'&gt;&lt;class 'str'&gt;Python is strongly typed - i. e. you can’t mix unrelated data types.  In other words, while you can add an int to a float to get a float as the result, you can’t add an int and a string like JavaScript would allow. For example, you can type the following bit of code which adds a number to a string into a JavaScript console and get an output. &gt;  Hello  + 123&gt;  Hello123 Python on the other hand will throw an error. # Adding a 'float' to an 'int' works because both are numericprint(4 + 2. 5)# Adding a 'string' to a number fails, thoughprint( Hello  + 123)6. 5---------------------------------------------------------------------------TypeError                 Traceback (most recent call last)&lt;ipython-input-2-e6243fa645f7&gt; in &lt;module&gt;   3    4 # Adding a 'string' to a number fails, though----&gt; 5 print( Hello  + 123)TypeError: can only concatenate str (not  int ) to str Formatting Python Code:  Notice in the above example that comments can be put in the code preceded by a # sign. The interpreter will ignore anything that occurs after # in a line.  Code blocks are designated by indentation in Python. Use tabs to indent code uniformly throughout. Some editors can be set to convert tabs into a given number of spaces - this is fine as well. Whichever convention you choose, use it consistently. Python does not use curly brackets, semi-colons etc like C, Java, JavaScript et al. , so proper indentation is extremely important and can cause hard to detect bugs if not implemented correctly. While we’ll look at the concept of a Python “function” later, print is a basic function that we’ll use right away. NOTE: If you don’t want the cursor to move to a new line after print, supply the parameter end=   # This is a comment -- anything following a # sign isn't executedprint( Hello, world! )print(42, end=  )print(  is the meaning of life, the universe and everything.  ) Language components: Variables: Since python is dynamically typed, variable type is often inferred. Most often, variables are assigned using the = operator. e. g. a = 2 Operators: Most of the common operators function as you would expect. Below are some of the odd ones you might need to pay more attention to: * == is the comparison operator. = is for assigning values to a variable* != is the  not equal to  operator* %, the modulo operator, returns the remainder of a division. (25 % 3 returns 1)* // returns the result of the division without the remainder. (25 // 3 returns 8)* x ** y raises x to the power of y. Make sure to look through the Python documentation and familiarize yourself with operator precedence - the order in which the Python interpreter will execute them. For example multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction. Use brackets to avoid confusion in long expressions. Expressions: A Python expression is anything that resolves to a value (numeric, boolean, string etc. ) Statements: A Python statement is anything that does something with one or more expressions.  Numeric Data-Types: Although, we are mainly interested in working with strings, we need to familiarize ourselves with some numeric Python data-types.  Numeric types - Python will mostly take care of conversion between these numeric data types internally.      Boolean - True or False (evaluates to 1 and 0)   Integers - 2 bytes   Long integers - 4 bytes   Floating point numbers (numbers with decimal points) - usually takes 64 bits, or 8 bytes in memory.    Casting Numeric Data Types: Casting involves changing one data-type into another. In general, for numeric operations involving multiple numeric types, Python will cast up. In other words, it will return results in the broader type. So boolean values (which can be written as True or False) will be cast into integers, which in turn will be cast into floating point numbers when necessary. Make sure you understand how the following operations work and experiment with similar examples of your own: # The first two produce boolean outputs. The third casts them into integers before adding. print(True)print(False)print(True + False)# The first produces an 'int', the second a 'float'print(True + 20)print(False + 20. 0)print(25 + 3)print(25. 0 + 3) print(24 / 3)  # Notice that this casts the result UP to a floatprint(24 / 3. 0)print(25. 0 / 3)TrueFalse12120. 02828. 08. 08. 08. 333333333333334Casting can also be done explicitly if you want to switch between data-types. Compare the outputs of the following operations to the ones above: print(int(True))print(float(False))print(True + float(False))print(True + float(20))print(False + int(20. 0))print(int(bool(25)))print(bool(0. 0001))print(bool(0))print(25 + float(3))print(25 + bool(3))print(25 / float(3))print(float(100/3))print(bool(100-100. 001))print(bool(100-100. 00))10. 01. 021. 0201TrueFalse28. 0268. 33333333333333433. 333333333333336TrueFalse Conditionals: Conditionals: if: If-then-else statements are the basic way to control the logical flow of a program. The basic syntax is as follows: 	if [condition]:		# execute this code block if 		# condition evaluates to True	elif [another condition]:		# execute this code block if the 		# first condition is False and 		# the second condition is True	elif [yet another condition]:		# execute this code block if the		# previous conditions are False		# and this condition is True	else:		# if none of the above		# conditions are True Only the first if is necessary. All the other tests are optional.  You can have as many elif (for else-if) tests as you want (or none, of course).  Only one else block as the default if none of the conditions are met (but you can leave out the else block entirely as well if you want to take no default action. ) As soon as one condition is met, no further conditions are tested. So, only the code-block of the first true condition gets executed. a = 40if a==42:  print( A is 42 )  if a &gt; 42:  print( A is greater than 42 )else:  print( A is not greater than 42 )  if a &gt; 42:  print( A is greater than 42 )elif a &lt; 42:  print( A is lesser than 42 )else:  print( A is equal to 42 )A is not greater than 42A is lesser than 42 Loops:: Loops: for: The basic form of the for loop is: 	for [variable] in [list]:		# execute this code block Each element in the [list] is assigned to the [variable] in turn and supplied to the code block.  The list can be any list of objects, but if you simply want a list of numbers, you can generate one on the fly with the range function.      range can be called with 1, 2, or 3 values (called arguments). A few examples will make their uses clear:         range(5) returns [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]     range(5, 8) returns [5, 6, 7]     range(5, 20, 3) returns [5, 8, 11, 14, 17]          Note that you don’t necessarily have to use the [variable] in the code block, but it is available and reset at every iteration of the loop. for a in [0,1,2,3,4]:  print(a, end=' ')print()for a in range(100, 1001, 50):  print(a, end=' ')range(20)0 1 2 3 4 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 1000 range(0, 20)Loops: while: The basic format of the while loop is: 	while [condition]:		# execute code blockAs long as the condition evaluates to True, the code block will keep getting executed. Note that you are responsible for making sure that some value in the condition is updated in the code block so that it eventually evaluates to False and exits. Otherwise you will enter and “infinite loop” - a computational black hole so strong that it sucks in every variable in sight. q=0while q!=10:  print(q, end=' ')  q+=1Interrupting Loops: break and continue: It is good programming practice to design loops such that they end only when the main condition is met. i. e. when the for statement has parsed through every element in the [list] or when the while condition finally evaluates to False. However, there might be cases where it is necessary to interrupt the loop from within its code block.  The break statement exits the loop and jumps to whatever is outside the loop’s code block.  The continue statement only exits the current iteration of the loop. It will continue with the next value in the list is a for loop or go back to evaluating the [condition] in a while loop. In case you enter an infinite loop, you can save the universe by typing ^C (Control-C) to forcefully exit the program. for a in range(10):  if a == 5:    break  else:    print(a, end=' ')    print()for a in range(10):  if a == 5:    continue  print(a, end=' ')0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 List: Lists consist of ordered objects. Note that the different elements of a list do not need to be of the same dtatatype, in fact they can be other lists as well.  Lists can be indexed (numbering begins from 0): list[index]     Note that negative values denote counting from the end of a list.     Lists can be sliced: list[start:end:stride] The following functions can be used on lists:     len()   min()   max()    the del operator can be used on lists:     e. g. del list[index] or even del list[slice]   l = list(range(10))print(l)print(l[0])print(l[-1])print(l[4:7])print(l[0:8:2])print(l[2:-2])del l[2]print(l)l = [42, 3. 14,  Hello , [1, 2, 2. 5]]print(l[1])print(l[3])print(l[3][2])[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]09[4, 5, 6][0, 2, 4, 6][2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]3. 14[1, 2, 2. 5]2. 5Note that like all python datatypes, lists are also objects. So, every list object has several built in “attributes” that can be invoked by the . operator.  l. append(): Adds an element l. extend(): Adds a list l. index(x, [start, stop]): returns the index of the first occurence of x in the list or in the oprional range.  l. insert(i, x) : inserts element x at position i l. pop([i]): returns the i-th element and removes it from the list. Removed last element by default.  l. remove(x): Searches for x and removes it from the list l. reverse(): Reverses items in list l. sort(): sorts list Tuple: Tuples are also ordered objects that are very similar to lists but with the important difference that they cannot be modified. l = [1,2,3]t = (1,2,3. 12)l[1] = 10print(l)print(t)t[1] = 10 # Throws an error[1, 10, 3](1, 2, 3. 12)---------------------------------------------------------------------------TypeError                 Traceback (most recent call last)&lt;ipython-input-1-120f9bad8820&gt; in &lt;module&gt;   4 print(l)   5 print(t)----&gt; 6 t[1] = 10 # Throws an errorTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignmentAs we might expect, the list attribute functions that modify the list don’t exist for tuples. Tuples can be modified by overwriting the original, but can’t be modified in place. Note: A tuple with a single element can be indicated with a comma within the round brackets as below. t = t + (43, )print(t)t. append(43)  # Doesn't work(1, 2, 3. 12, 43)---------------------------------------------------------------------------AttributeError              Traceback (most recent call last)&lt;ipython-input-2-c6597680d388&gt; in &lt;module&gt;   1 t = t + (43, )   2 print(t)----&gt; 3 t. append(43)  # Doesn't workAttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'Use tuples for immutable data and lists for mutable data. Another key difference is that lists, being mutable, cannot be used as dictionary (see below) keys, while tuples can. a = [3,4,1,5]a. sort() # Note sort modifies in place - doesn't return a valueprint(a)b = (3,4,1,5)#b. sort()sorted(b) # Returns a list[1, 3, 4, 5][1, 3, 4, 5] String: Strings are sequences of characters that behave like tuples. Indexing and slicing work on strings. Strings are immutable in Python - i. e. they can’t be changed without creating a new string object.

As we saw in the case of the list class, strings have several built in functions. Below are a few examples. A more detailed list of these functions can be found in the Python documentation and you should familiarize yourself with them. s =  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? print(s. split())print(s. split( e ))print(s. upper())print(s. lower())# A literal string works just like any other string object. Instead of writing s =    Hello?   print(s. strip())# . . . you can also write. print(  Hello?   . strip())['Shall', 'I', 'compare', 'thee', 'to', 'a',  summer's , 'day?']['Shall I compar', ' th', '', ' to a summ',  r's day? ]SHALL I COMPARE THEE TO A SUMMER'S DAY?shall i compare thee to a summer's day?Hello?Hello?Formatting strings: Python has a wide array of string formatting functions. Here we will look briefly at the format() method of the string class. More information can be found here We can format numbers and spacing - d denotes int, f float, s strings. Formatting and alignment is denoted with the {:&lt;} syntax. See examples below. # Insert variables into a stringprint('This is a {} formatting {}'. format('string', 'example'))# Insert numbersprint('Hello {},{},{}'. format(1,2,3. 0))# Alignment and padding of numbersprint('{:&gt;08d}--{:&gt;4. 2f}--{:&gt; 2. 2f}'. format(123, 3. 14, 3. 14))# Alignment and padding with stringsprint('{:^20s}{:. &gt;20s}'. format('Hello', 'World'))This is a string formatting exampleHello 1,2,3. 000000123--3. 14-- 3. 14    Hello    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . World List Comprehension: List comprehensions are a way of transforming one list into another, possibly with some condition based selection. They can replace loops that go over a list, perform some transformation on each element and append the results to a new list. # Using a for loop to compute squares of all numbers in a listl = list(range(10))s = []for n in l:  s. append(n**2)print(s)[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]# The above can be written with a list comprehensionl = list(range(10))s = [n**2 for n in l]print(s)[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]# We may also apply a condition - to get squares of just the even numbersl = list(range(10))s = [n**2 for n in l if n%2==0]print(s)[0, 4, 16, 36, 64]Dictionaries: Dictionaries are mapping or hash types. They are indexed but unordered collections of objects.  Dictionaries are created in the form d = {'key1': value1, 'key2': value2} etc.  You can access or assign elements by indexing with the key:     e. g. d['key1'] will return value1    Keys can be deleted with del (same as in lists above) The d. has_key(key) attribute tests if a key is a member of the dictionary.  The d. keys() attribute returns all the keys in the dictionary as a list.  len() will give the number of keys in a dictionaryLists and dictionaries are two of the most important and frequently encountered data-types, especially in text-processing. Please make sure that you are comfortable with both of them - adding or changing elements, extracting values, sorting etc. Also, the distinction between lists and dictionaries is important - “ordered” vs. “unordered” - this implies very different ways of retrieving elements - you must have a key (not an index) to refer to elements in a dictionary. Finally, both lists and dictionaries can contain any combination of data-types and objects, including other lists and dictionaries. d = {'q': 1, 'w':3. 14, 4: Hello , (1,2):[1,2,3]}print(d['q'])print(d[(1,2)])print(d[(1,2)][2])1[1, 2, 3]3Note the following ways of iterating over elements in a dictionary. The order of the items is not guaranteed and should not be assumed to be repeatable. d = {'q':1, 'w':2, 'e':3}for k in d:  print(k, d[k])  for k, v in d. items():  print(k, v)q 1w 2e 3q 1w 2e 3On dictionary order in PythonHaving stated before that Dictionaries are unordered in Python, it is time to contradict myself. But we need to go into a bit of detail. Dictionaries are insertion ordered starting in Python 3. 7 (3. 6 for the CPython implementation). This means that elements will be stored in the order that they are created – allowing us to sort dictionaries using dictionary comprehensions(see below). However, the OrderedDict class remains the preferred way if true ordering of elements is required. We will look at that class later along with DefaultDict Sorting dictionaries by key or value: # We can sort by keys using a dictionary comprehension ## -- this works because dictionaries in Python 3. 7+ retain insertion order. d = {'q':2, 'w': 1, 'e': 3}print(sorted(d))print({k:d[k] for k in sorted(d)})list(d. keys())['e', 'q', 'w']{'e': 3, 'q': 2, 'w': 1}['q', 'w', 'e']# sort dictionary by valueprint(d. __getitem__('e'))print(d['e'])print(sorted(d, key=d. __getitem__))print({k:d[k] for k in sorted(d, key=d. __getitem__)})33['w', 'q', 'e']{'w': 1, 'q': 2, 'e': 3}print(d)print(d. items())print(sorted(d. items(), key=lambda x: x[0]))print(sorted(d. items(), key=lambda x: x[1]))#print({k:v for k, v in sorted(d. items(), key=lambda x: x[0])})#print({k:v for k, v in sorted(d. items(), key=lambda x: x[1])}){'q': 2, 'w': 1, 'e': 3}dict_items([('q', 2), ('w', 1), ('e', 3)])[('e', 3), ('q', 2), ('w', 1)][('w', 1), ('q', 2), ('e', 3)] Functions: Functions help us break down programs into more modular and manageable units. They take a set of predefined arguments. def add(a, b):       Parameters:    a: Numerical. This is the gravity constant.     b: Numerical.   Returns:    Numerical. The sum of a and b    Takes two arguments and prints the first and returns their sum.        print(a)  return a+bq = 40w = 50print(add(w, q))(50, 40)You can define the default value of certain arguments. If a default value exists and the argument can be ommitted: def divide(a, b = 2):  return a / bprint(divide(20))  # Prints 10, as default value of b is usedprint(divide(20, 4)) # Prints 510. 05. 0Passing by value or referencePrimitive datatypes are passed to functions by value, while sequence or mapping datatypes are passed by reference. i. e. If a numeric variable is passed as an argument to a function and is modified within it, the variable’s value outside the function is not modified. However, for a list the value outside the function is modified as well. Note: This is generally bad programming practice and you should avoid changing lists inside functions unless you have a very good reason to do it. a = 10def test(x):  x = 100  return xprint(a)print(test(a))print(a)1010010l = [1,2,3]def hocuspocus(x):  #x[1] = 100  print(x)  x = 100  return xprint(l)print(hocuspocus(l))print(l)[1, 2, 3][1, 2, 3]100[1, 2, 3]a = 40def test(a):  print( Inside test:   + str(a))     # This will print 20, not 40.   return aprint(test(20))print(a)Inside test: 202040To exit a function without returning a value simply use the return keyword by itself. Multiple values can be returned in a tuple. You can say, for example return a, b and receive the values in two variables. def test(x):  return [x+2, x+4]print(test(2))x, y = test(10)print(x, y)[4, 6]12 14 Files: A file object can be created using the open() statement. Files can be read one all together with read() or one line at a time with readlines() p =  /Users/anupam/Desktop/Corpora/author_collections/shakespeare/plaintext/1_king_henry_iv. txt f = open(p, 'r')#print(f. read()[:100])print(f. readlines()[:5])['\t\n', ' \tSo shaken as we are, so wan with care,\n', '\n', '\tFind we a time for frighted peace to pant,\n', '\n'] Importing Modules and Packages: Large programs are often subdivided into packages that are made up of individual modules. Modules and packages also contain Python’s built in libraries and let us use the immense power of these ready-made functions.    Syntax examples:    import module from module import definition from module import *       Packages are collections of modules. Syntax:    # loads the fill submodule import Graphics. Primitive. fill  # This is a better way to do it.  # You can refer to the fill submodule without the prefix from Graphics. Primitive. fill import floodfill      In the Python documentation: explore the string module, its built in packages and functions.      Modules often have a lot of technical functions that can be confusing, but getting used to reading documentation to find the functions we need is a key part of using Python’s built in libraries effectively.    glob is a library that we’ll use to read multiple files from a directory using wildcards. Note that the library has a function also named glob() that expands wildcard directory listings into a list of strings. import globpath = '/Users/anupam/Desktop/Corpora/author_collections/shakespeare/plaintext/*. txt'filenames = glob. glob(path)print(filenames)Basic Plotting in Python: We’re going to use the Matplotlib library for plotting in Python. Other options you might want to look into are Seaborn and Altair. import matplotlib. pyplot as pltplt. figure(figsize=(8,5))plt. plot([1,2,4,2])plt. show() x=[1,2,3]y=[2,3,1]labels = ['a','b','c']plt. scatter(x, y)for i, l in enumerate(labels):  plt. text(x[i], y[i], l) Regular Expressions: https://docs. python. org/3/howto/regex. html: import repattern =  [a-z. *] string =  hello world print(re. search(pattern, string))print(re. match(pattern, string))print(re. search( l.  , string))print(re. findall( l.  , string))&lt;re. Match object; span=(0, 1), match='h'&gt;&lt;re. Match object; span=(0, 1), match='h'&gt;&lt;re. Match object; span=(2, 4), match='ll'&gt;['ll', 'ld']"

			<article class="article-post">                
				<p>This post grew out of some interesting discussions on data-visualization in a class I taught. I will use data on test cricket matches played by all the major cricketing nations gathered from <a href="https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/index.html" target="blank">Cricinfo’s Statsguru database</a> to hastily sketch a couple of points, but my focus here is data-visualization, not the culture and history of cricket.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023-03-22-test-cricket/india.png" alt="India" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" /></p>

<p>I will not deny that this post runs considerable risk of getting distracted into encomia about the wonder and enigma that is test cricket. But I will do my best to avoid it. If you are unfamiliar with test cricket, I will refrain from telling you why what looks like five days of men standing around watching grass grow is really an extended metaphor for all that is pure in human nature; that what, to untrained eyes, might look like a dreary spectacle is actually the fiery drama of grit and perseverance, of elegance and valor, sin and redemption.</p>

<p>Instead I’ll ask a more prosaic question: how much does one need to know about test cricket to read this visualization, and indeed to create it? Is a visualization a self-contained representation of facts, or is it embedded in a cultural perspective? Obviously, it is both. But what are good visualization practices that might help us balance the two without overwhelming either? How do we fit as much objective information as possible into a visualization without sacrificing a clear, easily recognizable narrative?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023-03-22-test-cricket/west_indies.png" alt="West Indies" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" /></p>

<p>First, here is the objective description of the data. Each visualization maps every home or away test match played by a nation in their entire history. Each bar represents all the tests played in a series (the year is at the bottom, the opposing or “touring” team at the top). Wins are blue, losses are red and drawn matches are gray. So far, so simple. The wavy blue line is a running average indicative of “form” that scores a home win as 3 points, a home loss as minus 5 points and a home draw as 1 point. Away, the scores change slightly: an away win is 5 points, and a loss away from home is only minus 3, while draws remain unchanged. These are the facts of how to read the graph. Are they sufficient?</p>

<p>Quite apparently not. Fans of other sports would certainly be familiar with home-field advantage, but might wonder if it’s enough of a factor to merit a whole separate graph. Those with “domain knowledge” about test cricket might explain that several factors contribute to home advantage in test cricket including the weather and the pitch. The ball swings and seams (moves in the air and off the pitch) more in England, spins more off the dry pitches of the Indian subcontinent and bounces more on the fast wickets of Australia. Home teams know their conditions better and can custom make pitches to suit their strengths. So much so that often a team’s home and away performances will differ widely. An all conquering team at home – like India in the 1990s – couldn’t be called a truly great side until it dominated abroad as well. Hence, two graphs. But notice, the moment we stepped into the comforting assurance of domain knowledge we entered a realm of subjectivity and interpretation – things on which reasonably informed people might disagree.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2023-03-22-test-cricket/australia.png" alt="Australia" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" /></p>

<p>Now that the utter dispassionate objectivity of our data (“here are the results of <em>every</em> test match played by Australia”) looks slightly shaken, let us stir it further. Which parts of the graphs are objective facts and which more interpretive? Surely, the results of the test matches are objective. Well what if the “objective” facets of the data flattens nuance one might care about? A cowardly draw settled for because a team refused to chase an enticing final innings target is not the same as a valiantly achieved tie off the last ball. Well, the data-scientist reminds us, we are dealing with results, not some abstraction such as glory. To say that in the 1960 tour of Australia, the West Indies team lost two matches, drew two, and won one is a clear statement of what happened. Yes, of course. But one might care for more dimensions than are captured in the bare surface of the data. One of those drawn matched was the first tied test, and the closely contested matches in this famed “Calypso series” would signal the first phase of West Indian ascendency.</p>

<p>This is not to say that at least some aspect of the frustratingly qualitative and subjective category – “glory” let’s call it – involved in so many not-quite-victorious sporting causes could not be captured in a visualization. We might shade matches by margin of win for example. Or take the opposition ranking and form into account. This is what something like a Elo ranking system (most widely known in FIDE chess rankings but used elsewhere including in cricket rankings) does. But notice that adding rhetorical nuance in one aspect would probably come at the cost of clarity in another. The graph already shows a massive number of data points – every match ever played by a team. Adding shades (or perhaps weighted widths or heights) would likely make it extremely cluttered and hard to read, like overwhelming a gripping narrative with rambly footnotes.</p>

<p>So I chose a slightly different compromise. Separate out the objective part of the data from the more interpretive narrative I want to weave. The results of the matches remain untouched, but are overlaid by a form curve that tries to capture the ebb and flow of the fortunes of national teams, their flights of glory or depths of disappointment. This overlay is computed using the scoring system noted above – it isn’t some magical subjective quality, it comes “from the data.” But one couldn’t argue that it is objective in the same way as the rest of the plot. Any serious cricket fan is likely to have differences with my scoring scheme. Away draws should carry more weight than home draws. The quality of the opposition should be taken into account. When a team wins in conditions most different from their own, that should be noted. First away victories are more monumental occasions. The nuances might be endless, and we might quibble on them. But the point is that these are nuances, subject to interpretation, rooted in, but a projection from the facts.</p>

<p>So, enjoy my attempts at depicting a massive quantity of information in a way that is tractable and yet to try and tell a story with it that helps the viewer see the quick contours of the vast over a century old landscape of this wonderful sport. Look at the <a href="https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=start;size=200;team=4;template=results;type=team;view=series" target="blank">Statsguru result table for the West Indies</a> to get a sense of how difficult it is to grasp a team’s fortunes from the raw data, and compare it to story of rising swagger in the mid sixties followed by almost two decades of supreme dominance home and away playing cricket of sublime beauty and lethal precision. There are many more narratives in the graphs for the other teams below – plots and subplots, struggles and redemptive moments – in here. I will leave you to find them as you enjoy the plots and perhaps complain about how it limits or hides important aspects of the data. But when you do complain, notice how what you are complaining about is enmeshed in the rhetorical capacities of data and its visualization.</p>
